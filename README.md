# CryptoClustering

## Background
I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to show how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

I created elbow curves using original scaled data and PCA data  They both showed the best cluster to be 4.

Then I used hvplot to create scatter plots of the original scaled data and PCA data. The PCA scatter plot had tighter clusters showing the data was more precise.
